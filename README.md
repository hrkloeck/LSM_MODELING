# LSM_MODELING


This is a depo for me at the momenta to understand the various source of LSM modeling in MS sets

This is used 
[WSCLEAN source list format](https://sourceforge.net/p/wsclean/wiki/ComponentList/)

this is used in 

[crystalball](https://github.com/caracal-pipeline/crystalball?tab=readme-ov-file)

another way would be to do that in 
[WSCLEAN with predict](https://wsclean.readthedocs.io/en/latest/prediction.html)
TCCLEAN with write clean components to MODEL_DATA

Or to use ft and the component list in CASA to generate the visibilities.

[simulations in CASA](https://casadocs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/community/simulation_script_demo.html)

or use kittens
